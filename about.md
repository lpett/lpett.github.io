I am a 3rd year PhD candidate in the biology department at [The University of Vermont](https://www.uvm.edu/cas/biology) . I study aquatic ecosystem stoichiometry, structure, and function in response to atmospheric nutrient deposition, using the model system *Sarracenia purpureaâ€¢. I am working with my advisor [Dr. Nicholas Gotelli](http://www.uvm.edu/~ngotelli/homepage.html) alongside my labmates: [Lauren Ash](https://lvash.github.io), [Amanda Northrop](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Amanda_Northrop),[Alex Burnham](https://github.com/alexburn17), [Emily Beasley](https://beasthebiologist.wordpress.com), and Raymond Looney.
