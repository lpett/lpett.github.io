sec3: "I investigate the impact of the atmospheric nutrient deposition  on aquatic ecosystem stoichiometry, structure, and function. I use the model ecosystem of Sarracenia purpurea (Northern Pitcher Plant) in my experiments. S. purpurea is home to a detritus based aquatic ecosystem composed of pitcher prey, bacteria, phytoplankton, and micro and macro-invertebrates.  I work with my advisor Dr. Nicholas Gotelli and my labmates: Amanda Northrop, Laure, Ash, Alex Burnham, Emily Beasley, and Raymond Looney. Check out my research as well as my cohorts'."

# Section 3
sec6: "Current Projects"
sec7: "My stoichiometry work investigates the impact of the atmospheric deposition of nitrogen and phosphorous on N:P ratios in aquatic ecosystems."
sec8: "Manipulation of atmospheric deposition of N and P content and N:P ratios"
sec9: "Artificially manipulating the atmospheric deposition entering into the aquatic ecosystem within Sarracenia purpurea. This manipulation allows  me to  measure the response of an entire ecosystem's nitrogen phosphorus content and N:P ratios to gradients in deposition as well as the impacts of  stoichiometric changes  on ecosystem structure and function."
sec10: "Large spatial scale sampling of Sarracenia purpurea."
sec11: "Sampling S.purpurea over a large gradient of N deposition (0.3 to 115 kg/ha), from Florida to Maine."
sec12: "Phycology of Sarracenia purpurea"
sec13: "Determining changes in algal community structure with varying N:P ratios being inputed into a detrital based aquatic ecosystem."
