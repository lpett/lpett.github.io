<center> I am a 3rd year PhD candidate in the Biology Department at The University of Vermont. I am interested in aquatic ecosystem stoichiometry, structure, and function, in response to atmospheric deposition. I am working with my advisor <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~ngotelli/homepage.html">Dr. Nicholas Gotelli</a> and with the support of my current and previous labmates: <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/~anorthro/">Amanda Northrop</a>
