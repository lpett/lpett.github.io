<center> I am interested in aquatic ecosystem stoichiometry, structure, and function, in response to atmospheric deposition. I use the model system *Sarracenia purpurea* which is home to a detritus based aquatic ecosystem composed of bacteria, macroinvertebrates, and phytoplankton. Please check out my current research projects, as well as my cohorts. I am working with my advisor <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~ngotelli/homepage.html">Dr. Nicholas Gotelli</a> alongside my labmates: <a href="https://amandacnorthrop.com">Amanda Northrop</a>, <a href="https://lvash.github.io">Lauren Ash</a>, <a href="https://github.com/alexburn17">Alex Burnham</a>, <a href="https://beasthebiologist.wordpress.com">Emily Beasley</a>, and Raymond Looney.
